 * deploys it to the staging worker — silently mirroring submissions into the
 * production dataset (2026-05-25 incident).
 *
 * For write operations (which must hit the correct dataset or the booking
 * disappears as far as Studio is concerned), read the dataset name from the
 * Cloudflare runtime env. `wrangler.jsonc` declares the per-env value as a
 * worker var, which is the authoritative runtime source-of-truth.
 *
 * Falls back to the build-baked value when CF context is unavailable (vitest,
 * scripts, build-time) — tests stub the client anyway, and the baked value is
 * correct for the env Next was built in.
